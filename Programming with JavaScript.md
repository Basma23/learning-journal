# What is JavaScript #

The script consider as a set of instructions which the computer do the step by step or one by one to achieve a specific goal.

When we are running JavaScript it might only use a subset of all the instructions at each time. 

To deal with writing JavaScript code or script we should to determine our goal and break it down into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.

# What is an expression? # 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. [2] 

**We have two types of expression and these are:**

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE**

In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).

- **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE**

We can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. 

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS #

JavaScript contains mathematical operators, which we can use them with numbers. 

**Mathematical operators are:**

- **ADDITION** Adds one value to another.

- **SUBTRACTION** Subtracts one value from another.

- **DIVISION** Divides two values.

- **MULTIPLICATION** Multiplies two values using an asterisk.

- **INCREMENT** Adds one to the current number.

- **MODULUS** Divides two values and returns the remainder .

**ORDER OF EXECUTION**
There are several arithmetic operations we can performed them by one expression, but we must understand how the result will be calculated. Multiplication and division are performed first then addition or subtraction. 

**STRING OPERATOR**
In string operator we use + sign to join the strings on either side of it. Concatenation is  the process of joining two or more strings together to create one new string.

**MIXING NUMBERS AND STRINGS TOGETHER**

When we pot quotes around a number, it will be  a string, and we cannot perform addition operations on strings. 

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? #

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
# Declaring function #

**There are two ways to declaring function and they are:**

- To write a function we need to give it name related to our purpose to make others understand what we are doing, then we write our statement inside the curly braces, after our function we need to calling it to execute our statement.

- Some times we need to specify information for our function to execute its task, and to write this type it will be like this function, then its name, then between parenthesis our parameters, then curly braces, between them the parameters will act as variables. To calling this type of function we need to specify the arguments which they can provided as values or variables.
