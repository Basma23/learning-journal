# What is the Text Editor? 
The text editor is concedared as a part of software which we install and set up it on our pc or we can access it online by using web browsers, which allowing to us to writting and controlling the text espcially the ones that ue use to to create a web site.
there are many features of text editor such as the code should be compleated, the syntax have higlight, have many themes looks nice, etc.
Each pc has it's own text editor such as notepad text editor for Windows systems, and for linux each type of it has its own text editor, but we stell need to download another text editor to make our code more efficiant. 
I've prefare Suplime Text to use in coding becuase it has many features and I used to deal with it, also its contain IDE wich is a short cut of Integrated Development Environment. 
IDE is a backage of software whech we calld it suite. "IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package."
