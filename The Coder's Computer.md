# What is the Text Editor? 
The text editor is concedared as a part of software which we install and set up it on our pc or we can access it online by using web browsers, which allowing to us to writting and controlling the text espcially the ones that ue use to to create a web site.
there are many features of text editor such as the code should be compleated, the syntax have higlight, have many themes looks nice, etc.
Each pc has it's own text editor such as notepad text editor for Windows systems, and for linux each type of it has its own text editor, but we stell need to download another text editor to make our code more efficiant. 
## which Text Editor I've choose? 
I've prefare Suplime Text to use in coding becuase it has many features and I used to deal with it, also its contain IDE which is a short cut of Integrated Development Environment. 
IDE is a backage of software whech we calld it suite. The text editor is a software which IDE contain becouase the "IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package." [1].

# What is the Command Line?
A command line or we can name it terminal which is a window contain texts to appearing, processing , creating, and transfare folders or files on our pc.
## Why we use it?
we use it to almost exicute all same tasks or several tasks faster, and it can be much easier when exicute it automaticly.

# Basic Navigation
- **pwd** which refars to Print Working Directory, we use it to display the path or show us wher we are right now.
- **ls** which refares to List, which appear to us directory contents.
- **cd** which refares to the Change Directories, which we use it to move from directory to other.

# About Files
when we talking about Linux, we should know that we are concedring that all thing is  as a file, such as text, directory, image, for system we can say keyboard (read), pc screen (write), and so on.
The extension of file in Linux is usally contain 2-4 characters, becuase the Linux has less extension, and these charecters are refaring to the type of the file such as .exe which mean the file is executable, .text which mean normal  text, for photo it can be  .png, .jbg, and .gif. So, the extention for Linux is not very important, because the system will ignor it and enter to the file to define the type of it. When we use the Linux system we should take care about the sensevity coase the uppercase letters are diffirent from the lowercase letters. To make hidden files or directories we need to use full stop at the begaining of the file or directory not anything els.
