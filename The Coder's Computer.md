# What is the Text Editor? 
The text editor is considered as a part of software which we install and set up it on our PC or we can access it online by using web browsers, which allowing to us to writing and controlling the text especially the ones that we use to to create a web site. there are many features of text editor such as the code should be completed, the syntax have highlight, have many themes looks nice, etc. Each PC has it’s own text editor such as notepad text editor for Windows systems, and for Linux each type of it has its own text editor, but we still need to download another text editor to make our code more efficient.
## which Text Editor I've choose? 
I’ve prefer Sublime Text to use in coding because it has many features and I used to deal with it, also its contain IDE which is a short cut of Integrated Development Environment. IDE is a package of software which we called it suite. The text editor is a software which IDE contain because the “IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.” [1].

# What is the Command Line?
A command line or we can name it terminal which is a window contain texts to appearing, processing , creating, and transfer folders or files on our PC.
## Why we use it?
we use it to almost execute all same tasks or several tasks faster, and it can be much easier when execute it automatically.

# Basic Navigation
- **pwd** which refers to Print Working Directory, we use it to display the path or show us where we are right now.
- **ls** which refers to List, which appear to us directory contents.
- **cd** which refers to the Change Directories, which we use it to move from directory to other.

# About Files
when we talking about Linux, we should know that we are considering that all thing is as a file, such as text, directory, image, for system we can say keyboard (read), PC screen (write), and so on. 
The extension of file in Linux is usually contain 2-4 characters, because the Linux has less extension, and these characters are referring to the type of the file such as .exe which mean the file is executable, .text which mean normal text, for photo it can be .png, .jbg, and .gif. So, the extension for Linux is not very important, because the system will ignore it and enter to the file to define the type of it. When we use the Linux system we should take care about the sensitivity, because the uppercase letters are different from the lowercase letters. To make hidden files or directories we need to use full stop at the beginning of the file or directory not anything else.
