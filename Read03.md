# How to seeing your remote? #
When we want to view the short names of of all defined remote handels we just need to running the command wich called git remote on git bash. We can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names when we use the command git remote -v also.
Do you know what the deffirence between fetch and push URL?
When you see fetch URL you should understand that this URL was tooked from online cloud to local host which is our PCs, and push URL is the opposite from local host to online cloud.
Note that: when you want to fetch your work or URL to your local host, you will use this command on git bash which is called git pull, and when you need to push your work or URL, you will use this command which called git push.
