# What makes computer a computer? #

The computer needs to enter data, then store it, then process it and finally output it, to make the computer a computer,
as it deals with **0** and **1**. 

# How the computer process the input? #

The computer converts all inputs to binary numbers which are 0 and 1 and also needs to store,
and modify this information and merge the internal signals by millions of small electronic components united together which are called **circuits**. 

When the circuit is smaller, the processing will be faster. 

The CPU block connects the software to the hardware, and contains: 
- a **calculation circuit**, 
- a **logic circuit**, 
- a **receiving circuit**, 
- and a **transmitter** one. 

The CPU knows which circuit will be used and when, by means of simple commands that tell it which circuit should be used, as it executes the commands one by one. 

The main form of the software is the binary code and it controls all the hardware while we do not need to now write commands in the binary, because it is difficult to use, as there are high-level programming languages ​​such as Python, Ruby, Blockley, Java, and so on. 

**So, The software tells the CPU what to do.**

# What is an operating system? #

An operating system is a major program that manages how the software uses computers. 

So, we can use many softwere at the same time like watching video and chatting with frinds, even listening to music, and the OS will manage them.
