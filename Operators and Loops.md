# whay we are using Operators and Loops? #

**There are two types of operators and these are:**

- **Comparision operators.**
- **Logical operators.**

We use the operators of **comparision** to specify equality or difference between variables or values, and the result will be a boolean which giv as true or false

**There are eight types of comparision operators and these are:
- IS EQUAL TO ==
- IS NOT EQUAL TO !==
- STRICT EQUAL TO ===
- STRICT NOT EQUAL TO !===
- GRATER THAN >
- LESS THAN <
- GRATER THAN OR EQUAL TO >= 
- LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO <=

We use the operators of **logical** to specify the logic between variables or values.

**Ther are three types of logical operators and these are:** 
- LOGICAL AND &&
- LOGICAL OR ||
- LOGICAL NOT ! 

# What are the loops #

we use loop to a test for a condition if it return true to us then the condition will be chicked again til return false to us then our loop will be broken.

**For loops there are three types and these are:** 
- For loop
- While loop
- Do while loop
**For loop** is using counter for its condition which mean that it instructs code specifyed number for runing, and we write it like this for(initialization, condition, update){}.

**While loop** we use it to instruct the code to run each time as long as a specified condition is true.
