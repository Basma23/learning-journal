# Why are the colors important? #

We are adding color to our HTML pages by using CSS to give a life for our pages and to help our visitors to understand what are we working on.

**To specify the colors in CSS we have three ways which are these:**
- by RGB values.
- hex codes.
- the name of the color. 

Also the color pickers tool can help us to find our color that we are looking for.

The contrast is very **important** between any text and the background color; to make our page clear to our visitors.
