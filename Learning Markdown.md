# Learning Markdown
## What I've learn about Markdown?
Markdown help us to styling text on the web, so we can make the text bold, Italic, even insert image or bot a link for website on our document, etc. Also, the Markdown is simple and ease of use because itâ€™s mostly a regular text we write it with some signs such as these: hashtag sing, star sign, dash sign, and so on. We can use this language in GitHub.
## What are GetHub pages?
GitHub pages are public web pages which we are hosting and publishing them easily by using GitHub, and we can edit them any time. When we build our web page we will create a new repository and give it a unique name, then we will choose a theme for it by using settings of our repository, then we can add or writ our contents and style them by using Markdown language.
