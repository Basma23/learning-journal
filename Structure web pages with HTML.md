#  Structure web pages with HTML #

## Process & Design ##
When we want to create our web pages we have to point to these points: **Who our audience? Why they would come to our site? What information they want to find? and When they are likely to return?**.


We should to sketch your wep page how it will be look like, and we can use **Site Maps** which allows us to plan the strauctureof a site.


To organize the information that we will need to go on each page we use **wireframes**.


To help our visitors to understand what we are trying to tell them we use **visual hirarchy**.


To coordinate our information on our web page we use **size, color, and style**.


To make simle present of our information we can use **grouping and similarity**.
