#  Structure web pages with HTML #

## Process & Design ##
When we want to create our web pages we have to point to these points: **Who our audience? Why they would come to our site? What information they want to find? and When they are likely to return?**.


We should to sketch your wep page how it will be look like, and we can use **Site Maps** which allows us to plan the strauctureof a site.


To organize the information that we will need to go on each page we use **wireframes**.


To help our visitors to understand what we are trying to tell them we use **visual hirarchy**.


To coordinate our information on our web page we use **size, color, and style**.


To make simle present of our information we can use **grouping and similarity**.


## Structure ##

HTML pages are considered as **text documents**.
HTML uses tags and the characters between angled brackets define the **meaning**.
Tags are often point to as **elements**.
Tags mostly have **opening tags** and **closing tags**.
Opening tags can contain **attributes** to tell us more about the content of that element.
Each attribute need a **name** and **value**. 
We should know what tags that we need them for our use, what they do, and where they can go when we want to learn HTML coding.

## HTML5 Layout ##

The new elements of HTML5 point the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure, and provide clearer code. 


The older browsers which don't understand HTML5 elemts need to be told which elements are blocklevel elements.

## Extra Markup ##

When we write an HTML code we will start writing by DOCTYPES which tell browsers that which HTML version that we are using.


To add comments on our HTML to let other understand what are we doing on our code we write it like this <!-- our comment -->.


We can add id and class atributes inside tags to identify particular elements.


To group block-level and inline elements togather we use these tags <div> and <span>.
  
  
To cut windows into our web pages through which other pages can be displayed we use this tag <iframes>.
  
  
To supply all kinds of information about our page we use this tag <meta>.
