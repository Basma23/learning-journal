# What is growth mindset?
A growth mindset is the availability to develop ourselves by working hard on our skills and abilities, which leading us to greater growth and success at the end. Growth mindset make us lover of learn and discover the new things.
# 3 reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
- **If I do mistakes** I'll tell myself that if there is no pain so there wont be no gain
- **If there is something new and hard to me** I'll say the positive things to myself such as I still don't get the known yet and I'll work hard on it. 
- **If I've challenges** I'll take them as opportunities to learn and try new things.
